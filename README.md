## Hi there 👋

I'm Keyvhinng (/keɪbɪn/) Espinoza, and I do Software Development. I'm particularly interested in scalability, performance, and optimization challenges, and I enjoy learning how things work under the hood. I've done frontend (React) and backend development (NodeJS, Java, Python).

👨‍💻 Some of the tech I'm experienced in:
- Backend: GraphQL, gRPC
- Databases: Redis, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- Containers: Docker, Kubernetes
- Observability: Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger
- Frontend: React, Vite, Next.js

🌱 I'm currently learning Rust, Zig

🏃‍➡️ I'm always eager to collaborate on open source projects
